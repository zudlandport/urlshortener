OVERALL VS ACTUAL:

[original estimate], {actual time taken}

OVERALL SCOPE:
-plan - [.25-.75 hour]  - {.75 hr}
-implement in Django over standard HTTP:
	-ramp up to how to start a new Django project - [.25-1 hr] {2.5}
	-get database module functionality working - [.25-.75 hr] {.5}
	-actual application code - [1] {5 hr}
-put initial application on GitHub [.5-1] {.5}

est total:  [2.25 - 4] {9.25}

-partially because Django ramp-up was much slower than anticipated
-but the application coding went slower as well;
   -(though there's a nontrivial amount of a blurry line between the two)


-upgrade interface to JSON API (which is new to me) - [1-5 hrs] {n/a}
