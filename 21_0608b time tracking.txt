6/8 Tue
12:56-1:37		Outline & Plan (40 min)

1:38-1:49		set up Django project (10 min)

6/9 Wed
8:37-11:00		setting up Django project / transitioning into application (2hrs 27min)
11:00-12:51    getting into the cool parts of the code (FUS, model) (1hr 51min)
12:52-12:57    uploading (pre-model) Django application to GitHub before lunch (5min)
TOTAL TIME SO FAR:  5 hrs and 13 min

2:53-      Integrate Model


Remaining features for base functionality:
-integrate Model (migration, debug)
-tie Add to Model
-create List page
-create Fwd page
-create Add Custom URL page

Desired features:
-Go with my initial design of changing it from storing Varchar random forwarding string to storing it as an int, so the lookup time is int-based (except for too-long custom strings)
-Learn JSON, convert current http-based application to JSON API
