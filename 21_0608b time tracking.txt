6/10 Thu

Remaining features for base functionality:
x-integrate Model (migration, debug)
x-tie Add to Model
x-create List page
x-create Fwd page
x-create Add Custom URL page
-create ReadMe & support Branch for Final Version

Desired features:
-Go with my initial design of changing it from storing Varchar random forwarding string to storing it as an int, so the lookup time is int-based (except for too-long custom strings)

-the myfwdhit Hits Counter model should receive nightly maintenance, collapsing its each-hit-is-a-row data into 1 row of 'counts by hit for (this date)' every 24 hours (if all we care about is its counts-by-day)

-Learn JSON, convert current http-based application to JSON API
