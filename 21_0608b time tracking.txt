6/8 Tue
12:56-1:37		Outline & Plan (40 min)

1:38-1:49		set up Django project (10 min)

6/9 Wed
8:37-11:00		setting up Django project / transitioning into application (2hrs 27min)
11:00-12:51    getting into the cool parts of the code (FUS, model) (1hr 51min)
12:52-12:57    uploading (pre-model) Django application to GitHub before lunch (5min)
TOTAL TIME SO FAR:  5 hrs and 13 min

2:53-3:29      Integrate Model - initial creation (36min)
3:30-6:41      Model added to application & finish application (List, Add, Fwd & Hit Tracking, Add Custom Page) (3hrs 11min)
6:42-       Branch and Upload Complete Application


Remaining features for base functionality:
-integrate Model (migration, debug)
-tie Add to Model
-create List page
-create Fwd page
-create Add Custom URL page

Desired features:
-Go with my initial design of changing it from storing Varchar random forwarding string to storing it as an int, so the lookup time is int-based (except for too-long custom strings)

-the myfwdhit Hits Counter model should receive nightly maintenance, collapsing its each-hit-is-a-row data into 1 row of 'counts by hit for (this date)' every 24 hours (if all we care about is its counts-by-day)

-Learn JSON, convert current http-based application to JSON API
